# FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION
🌸 Flower Classification with Deep Learning
This project is a deep learning model that classifies images of flowers into five categories: rose, tulip, sunflower, daisy, and dandelion. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and leverages transfer learning techniques to achieve high accuracy.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains images of five flower types:

🌹 Rose

🌻 Sunflower

🌼 Daisy

🌷 Tulip

🌾 Dandelion


📌 PROJECT GOALS
Build a deep learning model to classify flower images

Apply image preprocessing and augmentation

Use transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet

Evaluate the model with accuracy and confusion matrix
